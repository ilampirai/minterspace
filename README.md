### Team effort

When we got to know about flow hackathon, we started exploring all the tech and things we can do. Only had 2 days to finish everthing as we started late. Flow gave us another 2 days time extension which gave us the energy to fully finish the project. we had a barebone version where you can generate and mint with no fancy UI. With the extra time we learned about niftory and start using its sample app as base and intregrated our A.I model into it.
