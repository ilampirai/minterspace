# MinterSpace

### Generate images using A.I and mint them right away

Stable diffusion is revolutionizing digital artworks. And NFT's which is the proper way of protecting and monetization those beautiful artworks so we combined them both and give you MinterSpace

### Team effort

When we goto know about flow hackathon, we started exploring all the tech and things we can do. Only had 2 days to finish everthing as we started late. Flow gave us another 2 days time extension which gave us the energy to fully finish the project. we had a barebone version where you can generate and mint with no fancy UI. With the extra time we learned about niftory and start using its sample app as base and intregrated our A.I model into it. 

### Tech used
- Python for A.I image generation
- Stable diffusion Models
- Nextjs for webinterface
- Niftory for blockchain and minting
